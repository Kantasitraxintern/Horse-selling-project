She will stop at nothing to quench her pure thirst for knowledge, performing all manner of experiments on living subjects—unauthorized, dangerous experiments, at that. Her extreme tunnel vision means that without someone to support her, day-to-day necessities quickly fall to the wayside."
,,,,Air Groove,Ruriko Aoki,"Just as my esteemed mother once did, I must train to perfection and lead others along my path!",Apr 6,165cm,Perfectly maintained,"The vice president of Tracen Academy's student council, known to the other students as the ""Empress."" The daughter of an accomplished racer, she constantly strives to live up to her mother's racing prowess and ability to guide others. To this end, she has joined her friend and confidant, Symboli Rudolf, in the student council. Despite her strict schedule, she still makes time to tend the flowers in the garden."
,,,,Daiwa Scarlet,Chisa Kimura,Second-best won't cut it. Everything I do is for the sake of being number one!,May 13,163cm,Unclear (refused measurement),"Unyielding, strong-willed, and cheeky, she wants to be number one at everything she does. She usually plays the role of the perfect, mild-mannered honor student, but the truth is that she hates losing more than anything else. If it'll help her be number one, she'll go through any training—no matter how grueling. She sees her rather showy roommate Vodka as both her motivation and her rival."

If there's something on your mind, speak!",Apr 15,168cm,No change,"A dashing performer who never hesitates to take another runner gently by the hand. You won't catch her flirting, however.

Her ultimate stage: the Triple Crown."
,,,,Gold Ship,Hitomi Ueda,"So long as it's fun, right? Right?!",Mar 6,170cm,Unmeasurable,"An unpredictable firebrand born with an extra helping of free spirit. She's prone to some dramatic swings in mood and motivation—one moment she could be setting up an elaborate punchline, and in the next you would be hard-pressed to get her to move. She seems to get along with anyone and everyone, but it is unclear just how she views her bonds with others. Truly, one could call her Tracen's greatest mischief-maker."
,,,,Grass Wonder,Rena Maeda,"Noble and gallant, I march on... towards my ambitions.",Feb 18,152cm,No change,"Though born in America, her parents' love of Japanese culture influenced her to also love all things to do with the country—to the point of being called the spitting image of the ideal Japanese beauty.

"
,,,,Mayano Top Gun,Mio Hoshitani,"When inspiration strikes, Maya takes flight! Copy that! ☆",Mar 24,143cm,No change,"A rambunctious young genius of an Umamusume who seeks affection from everyone she meets. Having a pilot for a father, Mayano Top Gun often mixes aviation lingo into her speech.

She views the world through the lens of programming and databases, carrying out her objectives in an expressionless and robotic manner.
